    Chantler, C., Kinnane, M., Su, C.-H., & Kimpton, J. (2006).
    "Characterization of K spectral profiles for vanadium, component redetermination for
    scandium, titanium, chromium, and manganese, and development of satellite structure
    for Z=21 to Z=25." Physical Review A, 73(1), 012508. doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012508

    Be sure to look at Table I, not the very similar Table II which lists parameters in
    different parameterization.

    We were originally using L Smale, C Chantler, M Kinnane, J Kimpton, et al., Phys
    Rev A 87 022512 (2013). http://pra.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v87/i2/e022512

    BUT these were adjusted in C Chantler, L Smale, J Kimpton, et al., J Phys B

    (see Section 5 "Redefinition of vanadium K-beta standard")  Both papers are
    by the same group, of course.

    Scanned pages from Deslattes/Mooney's notebook provided by Csilla Szabo-Foster.
    Added by GCO Oct 7 2019: Used the position and width values from the from the lowest listed fit,
    the one in energy units. Used the intensities from the Second lowest fit, the one labeled
    PLUS-POSITION SCAN (best-fit Voight profile). Also the notebook only included the Ka1 and Ka2,
    not the higher energy satellites, so I made up numbers for the small feature at higher energy.

    Scanned pages from Deslattes/Mooney's notebook
    provided by Csilla Szabo-Foster. Added by GCO Oct 30 2019. Used
    the position and width values from the from the lowest listed fit, the one in energy units. Used the
    intensities from the Second lowest fit, the one labeled PLUS-POSITION SCAN (best-fit Voight profile). The
    detector resolution ("width of Gauss. res. func." in MINUS-POSITION scan) is less than the Gaussian Width
    ("Gaussian width" in PLUS-POSITION scan) I haven't accounted for that, so our models still don't match
    Deslattes. We would need a gaussian_atomic_physics component added to our models. Also the notebook only
    included the Ka1 and Ka2, not the higher energy satellites, so I made up numbers for the small feature at
    higher energy or estimated them from data in Mauron, O., Dousse, J. C., Hoszowska, J., Marques, J. P.,

- tag: HAUSKat 2024
  description: |
    Data are from fits to the HAUSKat calibration spectrum taken by ~1 eV TESs at BESSY-II.
    They are NOT absolutely calibrated; the energies come from [1] in SRD-128, meaning Bearden 1967.
    For C, N, O K lines, which don't appear in SRD-128, we use Zschornack 2007, from Bearden 1967.

    detail in C. Klauber, Surface & Interface Analysis 20 (1993), 703-715.

    Klauber offers only an energy shift relative to some absolute standard. For
    an absolute standard, we use the value 1253.687 as the Ka1 peak as found by
    J. Schweppe, R. D. Deslattes, T. Mooney, and C. J. Powell in J. Electron
    Spectroscopy and Related Phenomena 67 (1994) 463-478 titled "Accurate measurement
    of Mg and Al Kalpha_{1,2} X-ray energy profiles". See Table 5 "Average" column.

    (1994) 463-478 titled "Accurate measurement of Mg and Al Kalpha_{1,2} X-ray energy profiles". See Table 5
    "Average" column. They do not provide a full lineshape, GCO interperpreted the paper as follows: Ka1 and Ka2
    positions are taken from Table 6 "This work" column Ka1 and Ka2 widths were fixed as equal, and we taken the
    value 0.43 eV from the 2nd to last paragraph The higher energy satellite features are not measured by
    Schweppe, and instead taken from an email from Caroline Kilbourne to Joel Ullom dated 28 Sept 2010 We expect
    these higher energy satellites do not affect the fitting of the peak location very much.

- tag: Zn Hack
  description: |
    This is a hack, a copy of the Hoelzer, Fritsch, Deutsch, Haertwig, Foerster
    Phys Rev A56 (#6) pages 4554ff (1997 December) model, with the numbers
    adjusted to get line energies of 8615.823, 8638.91 eV and widths 10% wider
    than for Cu. Those widths are based on Zschornack's book.
    The KBeta also appears to be a hack with scaled values.
